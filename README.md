# Samantha-Says-Arduino v1.0
This project aims to create a real version of the Samantha Says mini game from the Black Ops 1 & Black Ops 3 Moon Zombie map.
## v1.0 Specifics
The project is currently breadboard based. Using the Arduino Uno, connected to 4 switches, 4 resitors and 4 LEDs. It is able to replicate the mini game from the map, with some constraints. These constraints will be addressed in future iterations.
## v1.0 Future Plans
Future plans include, attatching components to a pcb, 3D printing the Samantha Says computers to replicate the mini game, chaning the LEDs from single colour LEDs to RGB LEDs to fully replicate the game. There might also be the possibilty of switching to an Arduino Nano if possible to decrease the size.
